Journal Entry: Chapter 7 Machines/Mechanicals

The thing that interested me the most was the Dante Orgel (Dante Organ). It was a sculpture consisting from five to twelve computer 
actuated and MIDI orchestrated flamethrowers whose inner chambers were amplified by microphones and had upto 40 meters high flamethrowers. 
In essence, they united industrial fossil fuel and information age technologies. 

This artwork was spectacular not just because of it's physical scale and soundscape, but also because it commentated on the many previous 
robotic artworks that were self destructing by using fire as the main focus. Fire, which is all consuming, references the self destructive
nature of the robotic art landscape and by extension also the human tendency to self destruct. The sounds of the fire mechanism amplified 
to glorify the horrifying rage of the flamethrowers. It also commentates on the use of technology in warefare, and combines fossil fuel 
violence with technology just like warfare materials do.
